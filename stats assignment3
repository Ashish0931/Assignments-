Problem Statement 1: Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15.
A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on blood glucose levels.
A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis 
that the raw cornstarch had an effect or not.
Null Hypothesis H0 : mean=100(The raw cornstarch has no effect) Alternative Hypothesis H1 : mean!=100(The raw corn starch had an effect)(Two-tailed test)

Problem Statement 2: In one state, 52% of the voters are Republicans, and 48% are Democrats.
In a second state, 47% of the voters are Republicans, and 53% are Democrats.
Suppose a simple random sample of 100 voters are surveyed from each state.
What is the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than in the first state?
Given data: Population 1: p1(Republicans)=0.52 p1(Democrats)=0.48 n1=100 
Population 2: p2(Republicans)=0.47 p2(Democrats)=0.53 n2=100Null Hypothesis H0 :mean1(Republican)=mean2(Republicans) 
Alternative Hypothesis H1 : mean2(Republicans)>mean1(Republicans)(One-Tailed test)(Right-Tailed) (OR) mean1(Republicans)
